   "description" : "Based on an amp match taken from the clean channel of my beloved and rare Friedman Naked. It is a well rounded, sparkly, shimmering and modern clean that is very dimesnional. It is dialed specifically for both 6 and 7 string guitars and dropped tunings, and it takes effects VERY WELL. Dialed in with GIbson Les Paul Classic/Tom Anderson H3+ Bridge & H1- Neck, and PRS SE Custom 24 7 string/Dimarzio Titans. Throw on some chorus, delay, or reverb—or all of the above : )—tweak to taste and prepare to space out!",
